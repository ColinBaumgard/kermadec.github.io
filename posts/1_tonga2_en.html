<h1>Episode 1 : Tonga II</h1>

<p>Written on 14/03/2025</p>

<h2>Convoying to Lorient</h2>

<p>
    I bought Tonga II in October 2022. There was a lot to be fixed, but I was optimistic. The boat was strong and
    renowned for its seaworthiness. I gave myself two years to refit it.

    Tonga II was in Oleron, and I needed to sail to Lorient. This was not a smooth sail. The wind was blowing 25 knots,
    I didn’t know the boat, and I was afraid that something would break. The list of critical parts was very long, and
    the failure of even one of them could have led to a critical situation. I hadn’t slept for 48 hours, and my brain
    had switched to default mode.

    La deuxième partie du voyage, quelques jours plus tard, de Pornic à Lorient se passe mieux. Le vent et la mer se
    sont un peu calmés. Avec ma mère, nous partons dans la nuit. Après être sorti des passes qui protègent la baie et
    avoir laissé un champ éolien sur notre babord, je me détends et peut profiter du moment. Mon bateau n’est pas en
    bon état, les voiles sont vieilles et déformées, mais il file tout de même à toute allure. Nous arrivons en avance
    en vue de Groix et il fait encore jour quand nous nous amarrons au ponton du port de Lorient. Le lendemain nous
    remontons le Blavet jusqu’à Hennebont où Tonga II sera mis en chantier.

<h2>
    Hennebont - 2 years of work
</h2>
<p>
    The refit was underway. I had two years ahead of me, but I knew that my time was precious. I lived in Germany, more
    than 8 hours away by train, and I could only spend my holidays there. You had to be optimistic to embark on a
    project like this. But I wasn’t discouraged, and I started to dismantle everything. Everything had to be removed,
    unscrewed, and cleaned... It was long and tedious, but I was full of energy. I had been dreaming and preparing for
    this for 5 years.

<p>
    The wood had become rotted, and the whole interior needed to be redone. I only kept certain things (the floor, the
    structure of the bunks, the kitchen unit...). I spent a lot of time thinking about how to do the insulation, how to
    make this or that piece of furniture... I had to learn everything from scratch. Every 2 months or so, I went to
    Hennebont for a session lasting about ten days, sometimes two weeks. I lived on the boat, in harsh conditions. It
    was cold, there was no hot water, and there was only a shabby room that I used as a kitchen. Despite this, I put all
    my passion and energy into it. At first, I didn’t sleep much, and I didn’t eat well. I soon realized that this
    wasn’t the right strategy. Little by little, I got my bearings and learned to organize myself to optimize the work.
    It never went fast enough, but I had a lot of fun. My mother joined me to share a few sessions. I think she had fun
    too, and we really enjoyed these moments together. We sawed, cut, screwed, sanded, and painted all day long. It was
    a change from the computer days imposed on us by our jobs, and we weren’t complaining! I learned to relax and take
    my time, even when time was short. Isanka (my girlfriend) and Léa (my older sister) also came to see and help.

    After two years, the project had progressed well. I left Germany in February 2025, with a fixed departure date of
    mid-March. The schedule was ambitious, and I had to double my efforts. I threw all my energy into the battle, and I
    gave it all. It was a final sprint lasting 5 weeks. A first launch was attempted, but the boat wasn’t ready, and a
    problem with the mast fixings gave us an extra week. I was extremely frustrated at the time, but it saved us a bit.
    This week enabled us to finish most of the urgent work that would have been complicated to do on the water, and we
    could look forward to the second attempt more serenely. It wasn’t all smooth either, but by the evening of February
    28, we were sleeping soundly on the water! Tonga II was now called Kermadec, and she was snuffling her bow,
    impatient to show us what she was capable of.

<h2>
    A boat is made to float
</h2>
<p>

    There was still a long list of things to do before we could hoist the sails, but the boat was now a pleasure to live
    with. We went down the Blavet with a lot of emotion. We spent a week in the port of Lorient in glorious sunshine.
    For the first time since I left my job, I felt like I was on holiday. There was no shortage of work, and our days
    were full, but the atmosphere had changed, and we were more relaxed.
</p>

<p>
    We decided to take a break. The last two months had taken all my energy, and I couldn’t see myself leaving for the
    big journey without having been able to take a break. I was impressed by the patience and motivation of my sister,
    who spent a month with me, giving all her energy. We were going to meet up again once the boat was ready for sea, at
    the end of March. I was starting work again on Monday, with the aim of finally hoisting the sails at the end of the
    week! I can't wait to feel my boat running on the water again, to feel the wind in the sails, and to rediscover
    those sensations that justifie all the sacrifices.
